# Overview
Amazon EC2 Spot instances are spare compute capacity in the AWS Cloud available to you at steep discounts compared to On-Demand prices. EC2 Spot enables you to optimize your costs on the AWS cloud and scale your application’s throughput up to 10X for the same budget.

This lab will walk you through creating an EC2 Launch Template, and then using this Launch Template to launch EC2 Spot Instances the following 3 ways: the EC2 RunInstances API, EC2 Spot Fleet, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.

# Pre-Requisites
This lab requires:
- A laptop with Wi-Fi running Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux.
- The AWS CLI installed and configured.
- An Internet browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.
- An AWS account. You will create AWS resources including IAM roles during the workshop.

# Creating a Launch Template 
You can create a launch template that contains the configuration information to launch an instance. Launch templates enable you to store launch parameters so that you do not have to specify them every time you launch an instance. For example, a launch template can contain the AMI ID, instance type, and network settings that you typically use to launch instances. When you launch an instance using the Amazon EC2 console, an AWS SDK, or a command line tool, you can specify the launch template to use.

To create a new launch template using the command line

1. You'll need to gather the following data
    1. AMI ID: Specify an AMI ID from which to launch the instance. You can use an AMI that you own, or you can find a suitable AMI.
    2. Instance type: Choose the instance type. Ensure that the instance type is compatible with the AMI you've specified. For more information, see Instance Types.
    3. Subnet: Specify the subnet in which to create a new network interface. For the primary network interface (eth0), this is the subnet in which the instance is launched.
2. Once you've gathered the data, create the launch template from the command line as follows:
~~~~
aws ec2 create-launch-template --launch-template-name TemplateForSpot \
--version-description TemplateForSpotVersion1 --launch-template-data \
"{\"NetworkInterfaces\":[{\"DeviceIndex\":0,\"SubnetId\":\"subnet-05ef7d72\"}],\
\"ImageId\":\"ami-97785bed\",\"InstanceType\":\"c4.large\",\"TagSpecifications\":\
[{\"ResourceType\":\"instance\",\"Tags\":[{\"Key\":\"Name\",\"Value\":\"EC2SpotImmersionDay\"}]}]}"
~~~~

## Example return
~~~~
{
    "LaunchTemplate": {
        "LaunchTemplateId": "lt-072835f1531b31e88",
        "LaunchTemplateName": "TemplateForSpot",
        "CreateTime": "2018-05-01T08:03:31.000Z",
        "CreatedBy": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/schmutze",
        "DefaultVersionNumber": 1,
        "LatestVersionNumber": 1
    }
}
~~~~
3.	Note the LaunchTemplateId (eg. "lt-0abcd290751193123") or LaunchTemplateName (eg. "TemplateForSpot") of the newly created Launch Template for the next steps.

# Launching an EC2 Spot Instance via the RunInstances API

To launch an EC2 Spot Instance from a launch template using the command line, use the run-instances AWS CLI command and specify the --launch-template parameter as well as the --instance-market-options parameter.
~~~~
aws ec2 run-instances --launch-template LaunchTemplateName=TemplateForSpot,Version=1 --instance-market-options MarketType=spot
~~~~
That is all there is to it! You can see your Spot Instance request in the Spot console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2spot.

# Launching EC2 Spot Instances via a Spot Fleet request

You can create a Spot Fleet request and specify a launch template in the instance configuration. When Amazon EC2 fulfills the Spot Fleet request, it uses the launch parameters defined in the associated launch template.

To create a Spot Fleet request using the console

1.	Open the Spot console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2spot.
2.	If you are new to Spot, you see a welcome page; choose Get started. Otherwise, choose Request Spot Instances.
3.	For Request type, select Request and Maintain.
4.	For Total target capacity, set the number of units to request to 2. (These units can either be instances, or units of performance characteristics that are important to your application workload, such as vCPUs, memory, and storage.)
5.	Leave the Optional On-Demand portion set to 0.
6.	For Requirements, do the following:
a.	For Launch template, choose the launch template you created in the previous steps.
7.	For the purpose of this lab, you can leave the remaining values as defaults (some values may be empty).
8.	You can capture the resulting JSON config by clicking the JSON config button.
9.	Choose Launch.
The request type is fleet. When the request is fulfilled, requests of type instance are added, where the state is active and the status is fulfilled.

# Monitoring Your Spot Fleet

The Spot Fleet launches Spot Instances when your maximum price exceeds the Spot price and capacity is available. The Spot Instances run until they are interrupted or you terminate them.
To monitor your Spot Fleet using the console
1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose Spot Requests.
3. Select your Spot Fleet request. The configuration details are available in the Description tab.
4. To list the Spot Instances for the Spot Fleet, choose the Instances tab.
5. To view the history for the Spot Fleet, choose the History tab.

# Launching EC2 Spot Instances with On-Demand Instances via an EC2 Fleet

An EC2 Fleet contains the configuration information to launch a fleet—or group—of instances. In a single API call, a fleet can launch multiple instance types across multiple Availability Zones, using the On-Demand Instance, Reserved Instance, and Spot Instance purchasing models together. Using EC2 Fleet, you can define separate On-Demand and Spot capacity targets, specify the instance types that work best for your applications, and specify how Amazon EC2 should distribute your fleet capacity within each purchasing model.

To create a new EC2 Fleet using the command line, run the following

~~~~
aws ec2 create-fleet --launch-template-configs LaunchTemplateSpecification="{LaunchTemplateName=TemplateForSpot,Version=1}" --target-capacity-specification TotalTargetCapacity=4,OnDemandTargetCapacity=1,DefaultTargetCapacityType=spot
~~~~
Example return
~~~~
{
    "FleetId": "fleet-e678bfc6-c2b5-4d9f-8700-03b2db30b183"
}
~~~~
This EC2 Fleet has requested a total capacity of 4 instances- 1 On-Demand and 3 Spot. 

Check them out by running
~~~~
aws ec2 describe-fleets --fleet-ids fleet-e678bfc6-c2b5-4d9f-8700-03b2db30b183
~~~~
and
~~~~
aws ec2 describe-fleet-instances --fleet-id fleet-e678bfc6-c2b5-4d9f-8700-03b2db30b183
~~~~

# Launching EC2 Spot Instances via an EC2 Auto Scaling Group

When you create an Auto Scaling group, you must specify the information needed to configure the Auto Scaling instances and the minimum number of instances your group must maintain at all times.

To configure Auto Scaling instances, you must specify a launch template, a launch configuration, or an EC2 instance. We recommend that you use a launch template to ensure that you can use the latest features of Amazon EC2.

In order to configure Auto Scaling to use EC2 Spot Instances, you'll need to create a new version of the launch template to add the InstanceMarketOptions setting.

To create a new version of the launch template, run

~~~~
aws ec2 create-launch-template-version --launch-template-name TemplateForSpot --version-description TemplateForSpotVersion2 --source-version 1 --launch-template-data "{\"InstanceMarketOptions\":{\"MarketType\":\"spot\"}}"
~~~~

Example output
~~~~

    "LaunchTemplateVersion": {
        "LaunchTemplateId": "lt-0243ab7ff9821424b",
        "LaunchTemplateName": "TemplateForSpot",
        "VersionNumber": 2,
        "VersionDescription": "TemplateForSpotVersion2",
        "CreateTime": "2018-06-26T05:53:19.000Z",

                }
            ],
            "ImageId": "ami-97785bed",
            "InstanceType": "c4.large",
            "TagSpecifications": [

                            "Value": "EC2SpotImmersionDay"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "InstanceMarketOptions": {
                "MarketType": "spot"
            }
        }
    }
}

4. Select the launch template and choose Actions, Create Auto Scaling group.
5. On the Configure Auto Scaling group details page, do the following:
   1. For Launch template version, choose the version you just made that includes the InstanceMarketOptions configured (this should be 2).
   2. For Group name, type a name for your Auto Scaling group.
   3. For Group size, type 1.
   4. For Network, choose the VPC in which the subnet used in the launch template belongs.
   5. For Subnet, choose the subnet used in the launch template.
   6. Leave the Advanced Details set to default settings.
   7. Choose Next: Configure scaling policies.
6.	On the Configure scaling policies page, select Keep this group at its initial size, and then choose Review.
7.	On the Review page, choose Create Auto Scaling group.
8.	On the Auto Scaling group creation status page, choose Close.

You have now created an Auto Scaling group configured to launch EC2 Spot Instances.
# Finding Running Spot Instances

A Spot Instance runs until it is interrupted or you terminate it yourself.

Now that we've launched Spot Instances via RunInstances, Spot Fleet, EC2 Fleet, and an Auto Scaling group, let's go check them out.

To find running Spot Instances using the console

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
2. In the navigation pane, choose Spot Requests.
3. You can see both Spot Instance requests and Spot Fleet requests. If a Spot Instance request has been fulfilled, Capacity is the ID of the Spot Instance. For a Spot Fleet, Capacity indicates how much of the requested capacity has been fulfilled. To view the IDs of the instances in a Spot Fleet, choose the expand arrow, or select the fleet and then select the Instances tab.
4. Alternatively, in the navigation pane, choose Instances. In the top right corner, choose the Show/Hide icon, and then select Lifecycle. For each instance, Lifecycle is either normal, spot, or scheduled.
# Cleanup

## Delete Your Auto Scaling Group

To delete your Auto Scaling group using the console
1.	Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
2.	On the navigation pane, under Auto Scaling, choose Auto Scaling Groups.
3.	On the Auto Scaling groups page, select your Auto Scaling group. and choose Actions, Delete.

~~~~
## Canceling your Spot Fleet Request

When you are finished using your Spot Fleet, you can cancel the Spot Fleet request. This cancels all Spot requests associated with the Spot Fleet, so that no new Spot Instances are launched for your Spot Fleet. You must specify whether the Spot Fleet should terminate its Spot Instances. If you terminate the instances, the Spot Fleet request enters the cancelled_terminating state. Otherwise, the Spot Fleet request enters the cancelled_running state and the instances continue to run until they are interrupted or you terminate them manually.

To cancel a Spot Fleet request using the console
1.	Open the Spot console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2spot/home/fleet.
2.	Select your Spot Fleet request.
3.	Choose Actions, and then choose Cancel spot request.
4.	In Cancel spot request, choose Confirm.
